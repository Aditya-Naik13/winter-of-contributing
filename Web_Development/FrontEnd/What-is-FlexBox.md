<h1 color=cyan>What is a Flexbox?</h1>
<p>The Flexible Box Layout Module usually referred to as Flexbox, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.</p>
<p>It was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities.</p>
<br>
<h2>How it works?</h2>
<p>Flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time — either as a row or as a column.</P>
<p>When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes — the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it. Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work from the outset.</p>
